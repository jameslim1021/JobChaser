# JobChaser

Full-Stack, CRUD Web Application for those on the job hunt

## Motivation

This was the second project after 11 weeks of attending the Galvanize full-stack web development program and was done in a group of three. [My first project](https://github.com/jameslim1021/Canvas-Basketball-Game) was a purely front-end basketball game using HTML/CSS/Javascript so after learning the back-end portion of the full-stack, my group wanted to build an app that followed the principals of CRUD. As finding a job was (and still is) a top priority, we realized there wasn't a great tool for consolidating job search information. Typically this is done by keeping track of numerous emails, bookmarking job posts, and loose pieces of paper. We wanted to create a central location for users to browse jobs via Indeed.com's API, keep a personal list of jobs they're interested in, and related information to these jobs (notes, application stage, interview questions).
